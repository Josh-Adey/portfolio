               <h1> Hi, thanks for visiting my website. </h1>

               <p> With over 9 months of development experience in a numner of industries, I realise that the typical product creation process between clients and developers was flawed. Almost often, developers rarely communicate to clients throughout the development stage resulting in a final product that fails to reach the goal sought by thr customer and user. <br><br>
                   For this reason, I decided to utilize a completely different pattern that focuses on highly focused commumication ans transparent design pattern. When i take on a project, not only do I work to crat the application according to the client's specification, I give daily updates to ebsure that the application is aligning properly with the client's goal. The end resukt is the right product delivered on time and on budget.
